          <p>On 23rd January 2013 the website for the Department of Energy and Climate Change was replaced by <a href='https://www.gov.uk/decc'>gov.uk/decc</a>.</p>

          <p>GOV.UK does not cover every piece of content that used to be found on the website for the Department of Energy and Climate Change. The page you are looking for is probably one of these.</p>

          <p>Essential government services and information can be found at <a href='https://www.gov.uk'>GOV.UK</a>.</p>

          <p>A copy of the page you were looking for can be found in <a href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20121217150421/og.decc.gov.uk<?= $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] ?>">The UK Government Web Archive</a>, however it will not be updated after 23rd January 2013.</p>
