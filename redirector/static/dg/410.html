          <p>On 17 October 2012 the Directgov website was replaced by <a href='https://www.gov.uk'>GOV.UK</a>.</p>

          <p>GOV.UK does not cover every piece of content that used to be found on Directgov. The page you are looking for is probably one of these.</p>

          <p>Essential government services and information can be found at <a href='https://www.gov.uk'>GOV.UK</a>.</p>

          <p>A copy of the page you were looking for can be found on <a href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20121015000000/www.direct.gov.uk<?= $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] ?>">The National Archives website</a>, however it will not be updated after 17 October 2012.</p>
