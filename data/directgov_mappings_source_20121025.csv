Chapter on your rights as a temp worker is quite long and the info on having the same rights as permanent staff if you have been with the same hirer for 12 weeks is at the end of the chapter. Given the importance of this right then it may be better to have a separate chapter on 12 week rights and then this information and that concerned with qualification for 12 week rights could be in the same place. Also, opening sentence of chapter should emphasise that rights are available from the 1st day in a new job.
